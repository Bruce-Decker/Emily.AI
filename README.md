## Introduction 
Inspired by movie "her". We will build a conversation chatbot for people who feel lonely and depressed. This product will be a companinon in daily life, which will help users with simple tasks like searching, finding out about the nearest location. We will implement machine learning techniques that will make the chatbot smart and imitate a real human being. DialogFlow (API.AI), web based assistant and  Google Home Assistant will be used in this project.

## Solving Societal Problem 
In today's society, a percentage of the population feel lonely and depressed due to various circumstances. Many people are afraid of talking about their problems. Many refused to go to a psychologist due to cost and accessibility. Depression can cause gun violence and other crimes. 

## Implementation
Our company created an emotionally intelligent chatbot, which will help with an average user's depression. It's modeled after a lot of conversations and dialogs done by psychologists. In DialogFlow, it uses machine learning algorithm to train the bot so the conversation feels natural.
